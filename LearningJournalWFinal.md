Keeping in mind how much resources an application or activity in a cloud VM or web host needs is important for saving costs.  

The most common security issue with WordPress websites, as with many things on the web, is bad passwords and pad protection of them.  Next most common is the exploitation of old versions of WordPress and WordPress Plugins/Themes.  

Beyond that, SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting attacks are common, so following best practices with regards to data sanitisation and so on is important.  

Template Parts in WordPress are designed for code reusability. By separating common sections of a website into template parts, code duplication can be avoided and ensure consistency throughout a theme.

Ensure that template parts are appropriately placed within the hierarchy to override or supplement default templates as needed. This helps maintain consistency and avoids confusion when working with complex theme structures.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Understanding how to optimize computer resource tiers in hosting plans can make me a more valuable developer. Being able to assess and analyze the resource needs of an application or website can help in choosing the appropriate hosting plan, resulting in cost savings for clients or employers. 

Having knowledge of common security issues with WordPress websites and understanding how to address them is highly valuable in the web development industry. Recognizing the significance of strong passwords, keeping software up to date, and implementing preventive measures against common attacks like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) showcases my commitment to security. Employers seek developers who prioritize security measures, making me a more attractive candidate for web development roles.
