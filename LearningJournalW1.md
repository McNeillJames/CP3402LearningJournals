## Content Insights
Creating a basic site on Siteground worked as a good exercise to remind myself of potential pitfalls in writing html/css.  
HTML tags and attributes, and CSS properties are varied and numerous and could use review to reduce frequency of documentation/Stackoverflow lookups in future work.

Downloading a bootstrap template to work with made reviewing html/css in a practical setting much easier than if I were working from scratch.

Forming strategies to manage large amounts of content in a website is key to productive development - I used the Siteground editor to put together the Basic site Practical, but 
it's clear it will be cumbersome to work on the full assignment without a better dev environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning about Siteground and checking other hosting options helps navigate the importance of udnerstanding the benefits of features.
I understand the importance of efficient dev environments for writing projects.
