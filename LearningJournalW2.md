## Content Insights
Using a CMS to develop a working website saves a lot of time over building one from scratch, especially when assisted by available pre made templates.
CMSs implement common features in websites such as user permission systems and content restrictions, saving development time from re-implementing old software.

Vagrant is an open-source software tool used for building and managing virtual development environments.
Varying Vagrant Vagrants is a pre-configured Vagrant environment designed for WordPress development, which I anticipate to be useful in upcoming subject work.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Using development tools like CMSs and development environment tools like Vagrant are important to avoiding pointless busywork and time wasting.
